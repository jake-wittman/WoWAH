# Simple statistics

```{r}
tourism %>% 
   features(Trips, list(mean = mean)) %>% 
   arrange(mean)

tourism %>% features(Trips, quantile)
```

# ACF features

```{r}
tourism %>% 
   features(Trips, feat_acf)
```

# STL features

A time series with a strong seasonal strength will have seasonal_strength close to 1, a weak is close to 0. Same with trend

```{r}
tourism %>%
   features(Trips, feat_stl)

tourism %>% 
   features(Trips, feat_stl) %>% 
   ggplot(aes(x = trend_strength, y = seasonal_strength_year, col = Purpose)) + 
   geom_point() +
   facet_wrap(vars(State))

tourism %>%
  features(Trips, feat_stl) %>%
  filter(
    seasonal_strength_year == max(seasonal_strength_year)
  ) %>%
  left_join(tourism, by = c("State", "Region", "Purpose")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Quarter, y = Trips)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_grid(vars(State, Region, Purpose))
```
